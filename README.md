# Toyutils

This is an archive of all my toy command line programs on linux.
Most of them are simplified implementations of corresponding shell commands.
Here are short descriptions for each.

- `pstree`: a simplified version as the one on linux.
- `perf`: a naive version of perf just to collect and calculate time distributions of system calls.
- `crepl`: an interactive shell for C like the one that python provides.
- `ping`: a simplified version as the one on linux.
- `codesim`: compare the similarity between two documents of c/cpp codes.

All projects of these command line programs are independent
and they are placed in sub-directories with the same name.
You can learn more from `README` in each project.

## Build
The `README` in each project describes how to compile the project respectively.
However, we provide `Makefile` in the root directory to compile all the projects
with `make` for convenience.
