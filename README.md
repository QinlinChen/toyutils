# Toyutils

This is an archive of all my toy command line programs on linux.
Most of them are simplified implementations of corresponding shell commands.
Here are short descriptions for each.

- `pstree`: A simplified version as the one on linux.
- `perf`: A naive version of perf just to collect and calculate time distributions of system calls.
- `crepl`: C Read-Eval-Print-Loop like python interactive shell.
- `ping`: A simplified version as the one on linux.

All projects of these command line programs are independent
and they are placed in sub-directories with the same name.
You can learn more from README in each project.

## Build
The README in each project describes how to compile the project respectively.
However, we provide `Makefile` in the root directory to compile all the projects
with `make` for convenience.
